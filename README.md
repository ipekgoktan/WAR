# WAR

* I started off with creating the animation of the card placement. I created two rectangles that represent each 
deck and created two methods (one for the user & the other for the computer) that created a similar triangle on top of the deck
that glides towards the center. 
  I used this website as a reference: https://www.mkyong.com/javafx/javafx-animated-ball-example/
  
* I started adding simple logic to the game by creating a class for cards and creating array lists that represent decks

* I created methods that create a deck with individual card objects, shuffle decks and split the main deck into two parts
